# Portfolio-tamplate. 
Clone it...Edit it...Ues it 👏
# What is this repo? 
#### This is a portfolio template that you can use it as your portfolio by replacing the placeholder by your information or you can clone it and use it as your start template to build your portfolio on it.

# How this template was built?
 * I used [Bootstrap](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap&ved=2ahUKEwi5g5K86an1AhXmBGMBHcWVCxkQFnoECAUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0WenA-a-71iCDS5dZ071yP) for styling with almost no pure CSS.
* With a little of Javascript - [Actually it's only 10 lines](https://github.com/ibrahim317/portfolio-tamplate/blob/main/main.js) - to make the top bar sensitive to scrolling up and down. 
* And easily  HTML.😐
